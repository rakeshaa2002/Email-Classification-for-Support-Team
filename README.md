# ðŸ“§ Email Classification for Support Team

This project is designed to automatically classify incoming support emails into predefined categories such as Billing Issues, Technical Support, and Account Management. It also masks any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) before classification and provides the original data back after processing.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Input email is passed to the API
2. All PII is masked using regex-based methods
3. Masked email is classified into a support category using a trained ML model
4. API returns:
   - Original email
   - List of masked entities with positions and types
   - Masked email
   - Predicted category
